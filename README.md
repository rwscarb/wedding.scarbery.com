A smart marriage contract on Ethereum using `Truffle`, `Drizzle` and `Vuetify`.

## Install

Make sure `npm`, `Truffle` and `Ganache` is installed on your machine. `Truffle` is required with version `v5.2.3` used.
Use `npm` to download all project dependencies:

```
npm i
```

## Development

First edit the file called `config.js` in the root of the project directory.
The `mnemonic` is used by `Truffle` to deploy the contract.

Make sure there is enough ETH on the wallet to cover deployment costs.
Compile and deploy the smart contract to the private testnet using `Truffle`:

```shell
truffle deploy
```

If you only want to deploy a specific migration (e.g. to save gas):

```shell
truffle deploy -f <migration number> --to <migration number>
```

Start the web server:

```shell
npm run serve
```

## Usage

The smart contract is already deployed and can be found at:

### Ethereum Networks

#### Ropsten (Testnet) ðŸ‘‰ find it on [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xCC1dF672A2FE4F2C468dFa47cD0aE71326E5d62a#code)

Feel free to install MetaMask and interact with the contract.

### Assets

Assets are stored in an encrypted format on the blockchain to ensure privacy.
Ethereum does not support encryption at the moment so `CryptoJS` is used to perform client side encryption/decryption.
You can access the encrypted assets on the `Ropsten` testnet using the key: `setecastronomy`
