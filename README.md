A smart marriage contract on Ethereum using Truffle, Drizzle and VueBootstrap.

## Install

Make sure `npm`, `Truffle` and `Ganache` is installed on your machine. `Truffle` is required with version `v5.2.3`.
Use `npm` to download all project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Development

First edit the file called `config.js` in the root of the project directory. The `privateMnemonics` are used by Truffle to deploy the contract.

Make sure there is enough ETH on the wallet to cover deployment costs. Compile and deploy the smart contract to the private testnet using `Truffle`:

```shell
truffle deploy
```

If you only want to deploy a specific migration (e.g. to save gas):

```shell
truffle deploy -f <migration number> --to <migration number>
```

Start the web server:

```shell
npm run serve
```

## Usage

The smart contract is already deployed and can be found at:

### Ethereum Networks

#### Ropsten (Testnet)

ðŸ‘‰ find it on [Etherscan](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0xCC8d30311E4f13a9EAEA90b7505857FB2089F774#code)

Feel free to install MetaMask and interact with the contract (as far as you are allowed to ðŸ˜‰).

### Assets

Assets are stored in an encrypted format on the blockchain to ensure privacy. Ethereum does not support encryption at the moment so `CryptoJS` is used to perform client side encryption/decryption. You can access the encrypted assets on the `Ropsten` testnet using the key: `setecastronomy`
